# Explore US Bikeshare Data
- Cleaned code for readability.
## Notes
This project uses city bike data for analysis.
## Project Overview
This is a command-line Python application that explores data from US bikeshare systems in Chicago, New York City, and Washington. Users can filter the data by city, month, and day to view statistics on bike usage patterns.

This project is part of the Udacity Programming for Data Science with Python Nanodegree.

## How to Run

Make sure Python 3 and pandas are installed. Then, run the script:

```bash
python bikeshare.py

## Project Overview
This project explores data related to bikeshare systems for three major cities in the United Statesâ€”Chicago, New York City, and Washington. The goal is to understand bikeshare usage patterns based on various user inputs.

## Software and Tools
- Python 3.x
- Pandas
- NumPy

## How to Run
To run the project:
```bash
python bikeshare.py
```

## File Structure
- `bikeshare.py`: Main Python script.
- `.gitignore`: Ensures CSV data files are excluded from version control.
- `README.md`: Project documentation.
